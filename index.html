This is the general idea for the person card I am making for Elise Corrado.<br>
The effect I imagine is that when the mouse hovers over the card, Elise's photo is replaced by the image of a blueprint which has satellite images on art, music, poetry, languages and coding.  This represents Elise's interest in interdiciplinary connections and how a how different fields translate into another.<br>
The three possible effects are the satellite images:<br>
<ul>
<li>Static</li><br>
<li>Orbiting</li><br>
<li>Spiralling</li><br>
</ul>

Here is the <a href="http://codepen.io/selimtezel/pen/NrbMvG" target="_blank">link to Elise's person card </a> (very much in progress)<br><br>

Here are some links to things digital that I find very cool:<br>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.datapointed.net/visualizations/math/factorization/animated-diagrams/" target="_blank"> Prime Factorization Patterns</a> </li> <br>
I have always loved the connections of Geometry to other fields and this demo beautifully shows how prime factorization of numbers, a topic in Number Theory, leads to beautiful geometric patterns.<br><br>

I find that trying to generate Op Art by coding requires enormous mastery of geometric and algebraic principles as well as dexterity as a programmer.<br><br>
