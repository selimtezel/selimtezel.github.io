This is the general idea for the person card I am making for Elise Corrado.<br>
The effect I imagine is that when the mouse hovers over the card, Elise's photo is replaced by the image of a blueprint which has satellite images on art, music, poetry, languages and coding.  This represents Elise's interest in interdiciplinary connections and how a how different fields translate into another.<br>
The three possible effects are the satellite images:<br>
<ul>
<li>Static</li><br>
<li>Orbiting</li><br>
<li>Spiralling</li><br>
</ul>

Here is the <a href="http://codepen.io/selimtezel/pen/NrbMvG" target="_blank">link to Elise's person card </a> (very much in progress)<br><br>

Here are some links to things digital that I find very cool:<br>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.datapointed.net/visualizations/math/factorization/animated-diagrams/" target="_blank"> Prime Factorization Patterns</a> </li> <br>
I have always loved the connections of Geometry to other fields and this demo beautifully shows how prime factorization of numbers, a topic in Number Theory, leads to beautiful geometric patterns.<br><br>
<li><a href="https://beesandbombs.tumblr.com/" target="_blank"> Bees & Bombs Optical Illusions</a></li><br>
I find that trying to generate Op Art by coding requires enormous mastery of geometric and algebraic principles as well as dexterity as a programmer.<br><br><br>

<h4><i>Entry 7/9/16 </i></h4>

<li><i>What did you accomplish today?</i><br><br>
I am assuming "today" is refering to Wednesday.  We discussed our project mock-ups with my partner and showed each other the current state of affairs.  For the pair programming she showed me the basics of the software "after-effects" on how to create animations.  We did not code together.  Our projects are too different and we are at different stages so coding as a pair was not a possibility. <br> <br>
Note: At this point too much of partnership is determined by proximity to where you are sitting.  And most people are shy to go all over the room and make new contacts.  It would be helpful to hear some project ideas of people to see if there is an actual possibility of collaboration.  I think pair programming is a great idea but at this point in time we dont know each other as students well enough to see if collaboration is truly feasible, especially given how short the summer session is.<br><br>

</li>
<li><i>What do you aim to have done by next session?</i><br><br>
 After studying a few image -recognition API's I came to the decision that the current image recognition AI is not ready for my "What is this, daddy?" App to help my son and I identify flowers, birds etc.  So that project is on hold.  I started exploring MIT App Inventor data storage interface with Google Fusion Tables to make progress in my "FriendLocator" App idea.  I feel the friend finder app involves methods and interfaces that will be challenging enough for me.  In the mean time I will also try to make additions to the Mathematical/Scientific Visualizations projects with p5.js.<br><br>

</li>
<li><i>What can we (the teaching team) do to help</i><br><br>
Please make all the class coding examples easily accessible.  These are precious and nearly impossible to replicate by just watching.  <br>
Let there be a central place where people's project ideas are collected and displayed (allowing multiple possibilities) so we can identify potential collaborators or otherwise be resources for each other.

<br><br>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><i>Entry 7/12/16 </i></h4>
<ul>
<li><i>What did you accomplish today?</i><br><br>
I worked with Elise and Maisie on Maisie's project.  She wanted to add a filtering effect on one of her images.  Initially we had a lot of difficulty.  Looks like one of her .html files was corrupted.  Finally we got everythin working with help from Molly.  It was an interesting experience to have three people staring at the same line of code and trying to figure things out.
<br><br>

</li>
<li><i>What do you aim to have done by next session?</i><br><br>
Over the weekend I started working on an algorithm to generalize Mondrian's scheme for drawing iterations of embedded rectangles.  I created a prototype at scratch <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/115945709/"> Post-Modern Mondrian </a><br>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/selimtezel/images_project1/master/Mondrian1.png"><br>
I also started coding this processing p5.js.  By the end of this week I hope to have a version also on Snap!.  I also plan to work further on the Freind Locator app on AppInventor.

Same requests as before:  Please make all the class coding examples easily accessible.  These are precious and nearly impossible to replicate by just watching.  <br>

<h4><i>Entry 7/18/16 </i></h4>
<ul>
<li><i>What did you accomplish today?</i><br><br>
We created an ExcitementMeter with Maisie that responds to the sound level.  Code is available <a href="https://github.com/selimtezel/ExcitementMeter" target="_blank"> here </a> and the website is <a href="https://selimtezel.github.io/ExcitementMeter/volume-meter-master/" target="_blank"> here</a>. Please open in Chrome to use the audio set up.<br><br>
</li>
<li><i>What do you aim to have done by next session?</i><br>
I am hoping to finish my Snap!  and Beauty and Joy of Computing project titled: Simple Studio for Character Design and Animation.  Here is the <a href="https://selimtezel.github.io/BJCGithub/WebSimpleStudio" target="_blank"> link </a>.
</li><br><br>

<li><i>What can we (the teaching team) do to help</i><br><br>
Any feedback on the above project would be appreciated.</li>
