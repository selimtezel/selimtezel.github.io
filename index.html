This is the general idea for the person card I am making for Elise Corrado.<br>
The effect I imagine is that when the mouse hovers over the card, Elise's photo is replaced by the image of a blueprint which has satellite images on art, music, peotry, languages and coding.  This represents Elise's interest in interdiciplinary connections and how a how different fields translate into another.
The three possible effects are the satellite images:
1) Static
2) Orbiting
3) Spiralling
